# Flawesome
Flawesome is a modern productivity tool that will help you organise your day-today work and thoughts.
<br>
All the three application components i.e. The Notebook, The Sticky Notes and The Todolist are driven by the Calendar. This makes it more like a digital diary with some additional features.
